## Wordtionary

Wordtionary is an engaging game that combines drawing, guessing, and wordplay.

### Game Overview
The game consists of two main parts:
### 1. Pixel Drawing: 
Players start by creating a drawing using pixels. The pixel pattern is then converted into a word, which is further broken down into individual letters. To add an element of challenge, the letters are shuffled, altering the original pixel arrangement.

### 2. Word Puzzle
Word Puzzle: In the second part, players must solve the word puzzle. Successfully completing the puzzle will reveal the pixel pattern. Once revealed, players can guess what the drawing represents.
